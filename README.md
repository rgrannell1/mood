# mood.

![example screenshot](screenshot.png "Example Screenshot")

"mood." is a simple progressive webapp I'm building to learn a few aspects of web development.

- Hosted on Zeit.co
- Responsive stylesheets built with modern CSS

## Features

- Stores mood over time in an offline-first fashion
- Displays a graph and analytics of mood over time

## Running Locally

Unfortunately `now dev` doesn't run properly, so to run locally you'll need to run

```bash
docker-compose up
```
